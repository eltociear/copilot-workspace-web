        <p>The Copilot Workspace model is designed to enhance productivity and collaboration among developers. It integrates seamlessly with various coding environments, providing real-time suggestions and code completions.</p>
        <p>By leveraging the power of machine learning, Copilot Workspace learns from your coding patterns and the vast repositories of code available in the public domain, to suggest contextually relevant code snippets, functions, and even entire blocks of code.</p>
        <p>This model not only speeds up the development process but also helps in learning new coding practices and languages by providing examples and best practices.</p>
